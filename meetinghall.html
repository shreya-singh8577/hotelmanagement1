		<h3>Importance of Meeting and Conference Rooms</h3>
Business and corporate travelers account for a significant portion of the revenue generated by the travel and hospitality industries. People travel for work all the time — be it to complete an outstation project, attend an international conference or to meet associates and close a deal in another city. With rapid growth in the Indian economy, facilitated by industrial development, many high ranking managers and executives now choose to stay at five star hotels and resorts when traveling to another city for work. Companies also organize conferences, annual meetings and corporate events at some of the most reputed hotels and resorts, to impress clients and investors and thereby promote their brand.<br><br>

The best hotels and resorts have taken steps to accommodate the needs of businesses and corporate travelers. They provide such guests with important amenities such as:<br><br>

· State of the art meeting rooms<br>
· Spacious conference halls for larger events<br>
· Banquet halls for official parties<br><br>

Well-equipped conference and meeting rooms are an indispensible part of any premium hotel or resort. This is because corporate events and conferences are now extremely common. Events hosted by major companies and corporate bodies are quite prestigious and present an excellent source of revenue for a hotel or resort. Being the venue for a major conference or event helps boost the reputation of a hotel; particularly if the event is attended by dignitaries or well-known personalities in a given field.<br><br>
